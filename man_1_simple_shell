.TH hsh 1 "29 August 2019" "version 1.0"

.SH NAME

    hsh - a simple command interpreter (shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B hsh
.I [command] [option/argument]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
(Holberton shell) is an implementation of a shell in C that seeks to emulate the basic functionality of the original sh (Thompson shell), but hopefully with much-improved memory management!

.SH Overview

The hsh utilizes a dynamic memory allocation system in an attempt to ensure no memory leakages. The hsh is able to be utilized in interactive and non-interactive modes. It reads from standard input and parses the input, interpreting if commands are builtins or system commands. It initializes non-builtin commands utilizing the 
.B fork() 
function to ensure that the shell program remains active in the parent process whilst and until execution completes. 

.SH Invocation

As the hsh emulates basic shell functionality, the following limitations are observed:

-   Commands must be on a single line.

-   Arguments must be separated by whitespace.

-   No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.

-   No piping or redirection.

-   Only builtins are:  `cd`,  `env`,  `exit`

.SH Simple Commands
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name.  Then it looks for a builtin command by that name.

If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:

1. Command names containing a slash are simply executed without a search.
.PP
2. The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The shell will tokenize these directories so that commands can be appended to the end of them for execution.
.PP
3. Remaining terms after the command are considered as options/arguments and recognized as such by the executing program.

.SH BUGS

    Valgrind is known to report errors that, as far as can be ascertained, do not adversely influence program operation.
